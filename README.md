Objective:
The primary objective of the student grade tracker project is to develop an application that allows teachers or students to record, track, and analyze academic performance over time. This project aims to facilitate the management of student grades, improve transparency, and provide insights into academic progress.

Key Activities:

1.Project Planning and Design:
  Define the requirements and scope of the grade tracker.
  Design the database schema to store student data and grades.
  Create wireframes and mockups of the user interface.
  
2.Setting Up the Development Environment:
  Install necessary software and tools (e.g., IDE, database management systems, libraries).
  
3.Database Development:
  Create a database to store student information, courses, assignments, and grades.
  Implement tables, relationships, and constraints.

4.User Interface Development:
  Develop forms and interfaces for entering and viewing student data.
  Implement features for adding, editing, and deleting records.

5.Backend Development:
  Develop server-side logic to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
  Implement business logic for calculating grades and generating reports.

6.Integration and Data Handling:
  Integrate the frontend with the backend.
  Implement data validation and error handling.

7.Reporting and Analytics:
  Develop features for generating grade reports and visualizing data (e.g., graphs, charts).
  Implement filters and sorting options to analyze data.

8.Testing and Debugging:
  Conduct thorough testing to ensure all functionalities work correctly.
  Debug and fix any issues or bugs.

9.User Experience Improvement:
  Add features such as user authentication, role-based access control, and notifications.
  Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop use.

10.Documentation:
  Document the codebase and create user manuals or guides.
  Provide instructions for installation, configuration, and usage.
